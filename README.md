# Background Story

Codebase for following a course hosted by Pirple titled "Mastering NodeJS".
This course was purchased on 16th Oct 2018 for $6.90 USD. Five years later (on 27 July 2023), I started to complete this course and realize this course still giving a solid fundamentals for understanding NodeJS without any external libraries.

I finish this course on 3rd August 2023, and leave some notes to remember in the future. My digital certificate of completion of this course were attached as well. Exciting next that I listed in the bottom just for my own educational purpose as my journey to follow the path as back-end web developer.

## Closeout Notes

1. To run exactly the apps, don't forget to uncomment the init function for workers. I disabled it because it was drained my twilio free credit during the course.
2. "https" folder being git-ignored, because containing self-signed certificate and key which later being seen by github system as sensitive information.
